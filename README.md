# Journey

Journey is a personnal playground in order to create a multi-player game.

I deal with some well-known features such as networking, physics, game loop and rendering.

## Technologies

Backend : Java

Front End : Javascript (plain js + canvas in a first time)

Network : WebSocket (can be easily replaced wy regular socket)

## Try it out

Project is under Maven

Just build and run. Server is accessible at http://localhost:8002 and websocket is using port 8004

To stop the server properly enter "exit" (or "e") on terminal
